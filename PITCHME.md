#### What is Game Theory?

Study Conflicts and Cooperation between various entities though Mathematical Models.

#### Prisoner's Dilemma

- Started out as an idea at RAND Corporation.
- Formalized later by  Albert W. Tucker as a game with prison sentence rewards.

---

#### Scenario

- Two members of a criminal organization A and B are captured and put in incarceration. Both the members are isolated and cannot communicate with each other.
- The Prosecutor doesn't have enough evidence for prosecution and decides to give each person a bargain- betray your friend or cooperate with your friend by going silent.

---

The offer is:
- If A and B betray each other, both get imprisonment for three years.
- If A betrays and B is silent(or vice versa),  A is free and B will serve 5 years in prison.
- If both remain silent, Both serve one year in prison.

#### Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

1. Started out by Robert Axelrod as a student in 1962.
2. Prisoner's Dilemma is run a bunch of times between a bunch of strategies which follow specific rules.
3. At the end, Points are tallied for each cooperation and defection done.
3. [Axelrod1980](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.665.7955&rep=rep1&type=pdf): 15 strategies
4. [Axelrod1980b](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200278002400301): 65 strategies

---
#### What happened in the experiment?

1. A strategy named Tit-for-Tat won the tournament.
2. The strategy cooperates for a few initial rounds and then mimics other player's strategy.
3. This affirmed the fact that the behavior of "do unto others" works well.
